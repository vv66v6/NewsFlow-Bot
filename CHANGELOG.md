## 1.0.7

- Add admin `/news_now` command for a single synchronized AVEX test story.
- Disable post-subscribe article preview delivery for Telegram.
- Manual AVEX test respects shared story/image and starts the 120–180 minute schedule after full success.

# v1.0.3

- Resolve AVEX footer links from the actual Telegram destination channel username.
- Do not attach AVEX production links to arbitrary channels sharing DE/EN/FR languages.
- Increase normal news-body target to about 70-140 words when source material supports it.

# Changelog

Notable changes to NewsFlow-Bot. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and version numbers
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**The project is still `0.x`**, so the configuration surface can still change
between minor releases. [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md) states
what is covered, what never will be, and what 1.0 is going to freeze — read it
before you pin a version.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-25

Version numbering: this release follows 0.10.1. The minor field in this project
does not go past 9, so 0.10.0 and 0.10.1 were a misstep — both are withdrawn,
their tags and their images are gone, and numbering picks up at 0.9.4. Nothing
they shipped was reverted; templates, mentions and topic delivery are all here.
Their source stays reachable at `ca2a8db` and `5d8d43c`, but don't rebuild from
it: both carry the article-truncation bug fixed below. Pin `0.9.4`.

### Security

- `email_imap` sources now verify the IMAP server's TLS certificate. It encrypted the
  connection before but checked nothing, leaving the mailbox password and every
  message readable to anyone in the middle. **This can break an existing setup:**
  a self-hosted mail server with a self-signed certificate now fails to fetch
  until you replace the certificate or set `tls: insecure` on that source.
  Mainstream providers (Gmail, Outlook, Fastmail, Yahoo, Zoho) are unaffected.
- User-supplied filter patterns now run on the `regex` engine with a match
  timeout. The standard library's `re` cannot be interrupted, so a catastrophic
  pattern wedged the event loop for the whole process. Timeouts and invalid
  patterns fail open with a warning, as before.
- The Docker Compose file publishes the API port on `127.0.0.1` instead of
  `0.0.0.0`. A VPS has no private interface, and read endpoints are unauthenticated
  unless `API_KEY` is set. Your existing compose file is untouched; put a
  reverse proxy in front, or change it back on purpose.

### Fixed

- **Large feeds silently lost most of their articles.** The size cap on response bodies
  used `StreamReader.read(n)`, which hands back only what is already buffered, so
  any body arriving in more than one chunk got cut off with no error anywhere.
  BBC News parsed as 4 of its 37 entries and the Guardian as 8 of 45, while feeds
  small enough to arrive in one chunk were unaffected. Present in every release
  up to 0.10.1, in both the RSS path and `json_api` sources.
- Rate-limited webhook deliveries retry once instead of counting toward the
  destination's circuit breaker, which could disable a healthy endpoint after ten
  rate limits in a row. The wait comes from `X-RateLimit-Reset-After`, because
  Discord answers webhook 429s with a `Retry-After` in milliseconds.
- An `email_imap` message whose `Date` header won't parse now stores no
  publication date instead of 1900-01-01, which had placed it outside
  `MAX_ENTRY_PUBLISH_AGE_DAYS` and dropped it from every dispatch round.

### Added

- `discord` and `matrix` outbound webhook formats. A Discord channel webhook
  needs no bot token, no server invite and no gateway connection; append
  `?thread_id=<id>` to the URL to post into a thread. `matrix` targets
  matrix-hookshot's generic webhook and must not have a transformation function
  configured.
- `tls` option on `email_imap` sources: `verify` (default) or `insecure`.
- Guidance for running translation and digests against a local LLM
  (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, LocalAI) in the user guide.

### Changed

- `ENTRY_RETENTION_DAYS` default raised from 7 to 10 days, so cleanup cannot
  delete the oldest day a weekly digest still needs.
- A `webhooks.yaml` on its own now satisfies the startup configuration check: a
  headless RSS-to-webhook deployment no longer needs a Discord or Telegram token.
- `GUIDE.md` is now `docs/user-guide.md`, and `README_CN.md` is now
  `README.zh-CN.md`.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-06 — withdrawn

### Fixed

- Feed delivery hardening and DEBUG log hygiene: `DB_ECHO` is decoupled from
  `LOG_LEVEL` so raising the log level cannot flush stored secrets into the log.

### Changed

- Documentation reconciled with the code after drift.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-18 — withdrawn

### Added

- Per-subscription message templates with `{placeholder}` substitution. A
  template that fails to render falls back to the default layout rather than
  losing the article.
- Discord mentions per subscription, built from a native role or user picker and
  whitelisted through `allowed_mentions` at delivery.
- Telegram forum-topic delivery: the topic is captured at subscribe time and
  delivery self-heals to the default view if the topic is later deleted.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Offline configuration validation (`make checkconfig`) covering `.env` and both
  YAML files, plus cross-file target references.
- Hot reload of `webhooks.yaml` and `sources.yaml` via SIGHUP or
  `POST /api/admin/reload`. A file that fails to parse keeps the previous state
  instead of killing the process.
- REST API completeness: subscription CRUD, OPML export, and `/metrics`.

### Changed

- Unknown keys in either YAML file are now a hard startup error. A typo used to
  be ignored silently, which is how an HMAC signing secret once disappeared.
- ruff upgraded from 0.1 to 0.15.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Channel management commands, digest scheduling with per-channel timezones, and
  a `/manage` button panel on Telegram.
- Filter matching semantics: an ASCII-only keyword matches on word boundaries, so
  `ai` stops firing on "brain" while still hitting "AI芯片"; CJK and punctuated
  keywords keep substring matching, which is the natural unit there.
- Same-language short-circuit, so an entry already in the target language is not
  sent to the translation provider.

### Security

- State-changing commands are gated behind administrator permissions. Button
  visibility was never access control.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Telegram command menu and inline keyboards.
- `FEED_MAX_CONCURRENT` and `LOG_FORMAT` wired through to the runtime.
- End-to-end delivery pipeline integration test.

### Fixed

- The dispatch loop survives a failed per-subscription commit instead of
  aborting the whole round.
- Subscriptions owned by another source are kept when a source leaves
  `sources.yaml`.
- httpx no longer logs bot tokens; JSON tracebacks render correctly.

### Changed

- `mypy --strict` and ruff became blocking CI gates.
- `asyncpg` raised to 0.30 so installs succeed on Python 3.13.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-01

First release to carry a version number in the tree. RSS, JSON-API, IMAP and
inbound-webhook sources feeding a platform-agnostic dispatch loop that delivers
to Discord, Telegram and declarative webhook destinations, with keyword and
regex filtering, optional translation, silent mode, AI daily and weekly digests,
an optional REST API, and Docker images published to GHCR.

Tags `v0.1.0` through `v0.8.0` were added retroactively to mark development
milestones that predate versioning. They have no changelog entries and no
published Docker images.

## 1.0.4
- AVEX image identity is now based on a stable normalized story URL/GUID, so DE/EN/FR subscriptions share one image and one image/no-image decision.
- Added per-story image-generation locking to prevent concurrent duplicate image generation.
- Serialized post-subscribe previews with the main dispatch mutex to prevent duplicate article sends caused by a preview/dispatch race.
- Increased default AI completion budget to 1800 tokens and reject incomplete headline/body fields ending in ellipsis.


## 1.0.5

- AVEX news captions are generated within a complete Telegram-safe length budget, preventing ellipsis/truncation.
- Added localized AVEX.CASH CTA links to every AVEX news post.
- Added a persistent global AVEX autopilot schedule: one story every random 120–180 minutes, with the same story immediately published to all three language channels.


## 1.0.6

- AVEX production channels no longer receive post-subscribe preview posts, so previews cannot bypass the 120–180 minute publishing cadence.
- Strengthened AI output validation: headlines <= 120 chars, bodies <= 650 chars, and ellipsis/unfinished output is rejected and regenerated.
- AVEX.CASH CTA is guaranteed at the final Telegram send boundary and rendered as a bold clickable link above the channel footer.
