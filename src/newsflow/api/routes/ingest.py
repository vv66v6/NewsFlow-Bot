"""Inbound ingest endpoint: external systems POST entries INTO NewsFlow.

The push counterpart to the outbound webhook adapter. A ``webhook_inbound``
source (declared in sources.yaml together with its subscribers) holds the
pushed entries; this endpoint writes them through the normal ingestion path
and immediately triggers a dispatch round — "pushed" content shouldn't sit
waiting for the next scheduled cycle (up to a full fetch interval).

Idempotent by guid (client ``id`` or a content hash), so re-POSTing the same
item is a no-op. Writes require the API key (see ``require_api_key``).
